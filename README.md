# ArraySplitter


The array splitter class will take in a provided array and split it into equal sized groups. The number of equal sized groups is determined by a number of splits provided to the method. If there would be any remainders that would not fit into an equal sized group, they are put in their own group at the end of the array. Unittest test cases have also been produced to test the functionality of this class.

The classes and tests are written in Python 3.8 . They were created and tested using IDLE, however they will be able to run on either a python compatible IDE of choice or from command line.
